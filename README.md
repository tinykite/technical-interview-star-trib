üì¨ Check your invitation email for the name of the branch you should use ‚Äî for example, `mid-level-assessment/frontend`.

### Instructions
In the branch provided by the hiring manager, you‚Äôll find a sample ticket similar to what you might receive at The Minnesota Star Tribune. You will find the full ticket [at the bottom of this README](#assessment-ticket).

Your task is to read through it, understand the intent, and implement a solution. This is your opportunity to show us how you approach a problem, organize your code, and communicate trade-offs or ideas. If you see opportunities to improve the existing code, feel free to go for it ‚Äî or leave a comment noting what you'd change and why.

‚è±Ô∏è **Time Expectations**  
Please aim to spend around **1 hour** or less on this. No more than **2 hours max** ‚Äî we want to respect your time.

üí¨ **Stuck or Blocked?**  
It happens!

If you run into any snags ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs the repo not setting up, you‚Äôre confused about the project structure, or something just isn‚Äôt clicking ‚Äî please reach out to the hiring manager. Asking for help is a skill we value deeply here, and we see debugging and pair-programming as collaborative, not corrective.

If you need a hand, we‚Äôll hop on a quick call and work through it together. This isn‚Äôt a test of perfection ‚Äî it‚Äôs a chance to get a feel for how we solve problems together.

### Submitting Your Work
When you‚Äôre done:

- Push your changes to your GitHub repo.
- Create a Pull Request in your repo (draft is fine).
- Email the link to the pull request to the Hiring Manager.
- During the technical portion of your final interview, you‚Äôll walk through your solution with a team member and discuss your approach, trade-offs, and ideas for future improvement(s).
